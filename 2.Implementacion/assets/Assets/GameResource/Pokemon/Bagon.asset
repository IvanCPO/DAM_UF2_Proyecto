  description: "Bagon jumps off cliffs every day, trying to grow stronger so that
    someday it will be able to fly. Bagon is a solitary Pok\xE9mon that doesn't form
    groups with others of its kind. It also has a head hard enough to cleave a boulder
    in one strike. Dreaming of one day flying, it practices by leaping off cliffs
    every day."
